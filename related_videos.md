# Exploring winning in architecture - Finite and Infinite Games

Hey, welcome back. Today I want to explore the ideas from James Carse, particularly from his book Finite and Infinite Games. He discusses the concept of poesis, the act of creating art versus the poem, which is the finished product, right? This distinction is ancient and but might be crucial in understanding how we perceive architecture and also its impact on society.

Also, in finite games, the outcome is only one, it's the fact that there is an outcome. Namely, you could call it a win for someone. In the infinite game sense, the purpose is to continue playing, it is a play that reaffirms itself. But besides that, I think the question of how to win in architecture, or how can we even be aware of that, is the core of our discussion today.

I tell you architecture because it seems to be an ongoing game. And at the same time with qualities that qualify as finite, as ability to fit into a certain social structure, right? But it also has cultural associations that reflect a major context a major playground and so that's one case which it's colored by my perceptions of winners and losers.

or winners, especially in the architecture institutions, and especially in the eyes of students. Take the work, for instance, of Pezo Von Ellrichshausen, an architectural firm from Concepci√≥n Chile. And I think their innovative designs are often misunderstood by local architects who focus solely in the product, in the finished product, rather in the creative process behind it.
