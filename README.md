# The question of origins. 

If the building is the very result of the needs of the inhabitants it’s been said to not be architecture. When putting cultural affairs into play, it tends to become architecture, for the display of the willingness of the architect and his cultural background. That’s what’s usually understood. But in terms of poiesis, struggle, finite play, and continuous play the matter is subtler. 

If the inhabitants are poietes (poets), they consider architecture as an extension of a garden, a continuous field in which they are attentive to nuances and discrete features. In this continuous engagement, they find themselves creating or listening for other players who pay attention to materials, especially those who are stable enough to house their way of play. In this, they find themselves co-creating something, without much attachment to the result, but certainly admiring the very possibility of play coming to a halt, as they know the rhythm somehow. In this scenario, a particular way of speaking enters the conversation. It may be a bit technical. But technicalities are known procedures, thus resting vitality. Weather can at the same time increase or decrease the comfort levels of the players, so we enter into a sort of exchange. Nature, as varied as it is, offers no home. As the players rearrange their wants to include experience, they start a kind of play that may be less playful. In this direction, other cultural forces and predictions want to play a role, but the myth that induces the players to do something that resists them is already present. They negotiate, as they include money as part of existence, and they engage in transactions that involve a sense of time, thus maximizing some qualities that are suited for their style of play, and minimizing the ones that overwhelm or seem too serious, or that tend to generate winners. In this equation, technical builders are an option to take. How technical is a matter of degree, ideally, a craftsman who cares and can engage as gardeners as well. But it will depend, on what is yet to determine. 

Tradeoffs are everywhere, including the crucial trade-off of the very garden they find themselves in. Including what they had already seen from other gardeners from the past. The timing starts to gain importance as winters become harsh and summers suffocating. They can admit they could build making concessions with far enough places and cultures, to protect themselves quicker. Or they can move to another land, as nomad predecessors also did. 

But they want stability, they want to stay, as a we that knows it’s a we, thus having a certain sense of character in each member, not to predict their next move of the other, but to engage responsibly within the group. 

Let’s say one member keeps speaking, and in their speaking feels the need to be aside, with more downtime than communal activity, thus increasing solitude with the garden (a slightly different one), and the horizon.

In his activity, we found a shorter timespan for play and more focus on elements of the garden as resources. But his habitation is more feral and less concerned with past cultural affairs than the group. 

We can see, as he gets back to the community from time to time, a sense of detachment but also a high level of cultural transactions as his come and go starts getting regular and predictable. Another way to be less playful. 

This need for a detached state may form another variation on the overall wants of the group. This gardener could then have a different horizon than his peers, then, being able to see his peers in a new but objective way, a way that treats them less as players and more as a conformed object, yet still variable and unpredictable, but an image is formed. 

Let’s say that this very individual seems to be adequate to call overall gardening, which includes temporality and the way other gardeners play, kind of the same way another detached member may be suited for initiation, thus seeing persons as growing, making an abstraction of the growth he recognized earlier on the very garden. 

This kind of gardener can infer growth in the very person’s vitality, and detect the ability to handle temporality and cycles of downtime. If he gets specific, he can include in the conversation (at this point a labeled a need for housing) as the player who sees the need and sees the uphill battle or juggling act of building or making what the exchanges represent, again, minimizing the effects can cause the introduction of predictions over the style of play. He is in danger and viewed from the outside, his life is dramatic for being one of the few who gardens the gardeners. He’s still playing in any case, he’s still interested in a form of play for the group and himself. 

As he includes materiality and experimentation, he keeps an eye on the transactions. As he communicates with others, a divide starts between the gardener of gardeners and the gardener of materials. They play, but they know each time their differences, so they exchange and cooperate. This can be done at certain distances, thus increasing the horizonal activity between the two as they stack materials in specific ways, ways they rehearsed. They realize that certain stacks tend to increase playfulness, while others diminish it. How so? Materials are already an object detached from their idea of garden activity and vitality. Kind of selecting objects with less vitality away tends to not affect the vitality of the garden itself, but it is already a compromised land. It’s already an intervention, a creation of sorts at separating the more vital away. 

This vitality taken away starts to form and condition the stack, and at some point used to create a line of stacks, thus a wall that can provide a reference, arbitrate the play towards a distance, a direction, a sort of being beside. This is tested within the group. They end up wanting more, as long as serves the very initial way of play. 

That could be an archetype. A myth, even if imperfect. The need for tools is very delicate because tools are a defined path, and vitality it’s at stake. 

But, aside from these propositions, in some way, these kinds of players may not care about exact origins, so not care about ends. Like the loose construction of the bull ring. Maybe machinery cannot touch archetypes like those.
